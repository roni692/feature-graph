# 🚀 Graph Series: 10 Must-Know Problems for FAANG

Hey there! 👋  
Welcome to my personal graph problem-solving vault.

I built this repo while preparing for FAANG interviews — not as a checklist, but as a way to truly understand how graphs *think*.  
This isn't just about solving problems... it's about seeing patterns, writing clean code, and building confidence one graph at a time.

## 📌 Why This Repo?

After struggling with memorizing graph solutions (looking at you, Dijkstra 😅), I realized I needed:

- A **focused set of core problems**
- Clean **Java code with comments**
- **Real explanations** that make sense when I revisit
- A place to share with other developers who hate "tutorial hell"

## 🧠 What's Inside?

| Problem | Category | Key Concept |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| 1. Number of Islands | DFS/BFS | Flood fill, visited matrix |
| 2. Network Delay Time | Dijkstra | PriorityQueue, shortest path |
| 3. Clone Graph | DFS/HashMap | Graph traversal |
| 4. Course Schedule | Topological Sort | Cycle detection |
| 5. Minimum Spanning Tree | Kruskal's / Prim's | Union-Find |
| ... | ... | ... |

Each solution comes with:

✅ Clean code  
✅ Comments (not just code)  
✅ Edge case notes  
✅ When to use what (DFS vs BFS, heap vs queue, etc.)

## 🛠 Tech Used

- Language: **Java**
- Optional Visualizations: Coming soon
- Real-world mapping: Yes! Every problem ties to a real-world analogy

## 📚 Learning Strategy

Instead of solving 1000 problems, I’m focusing on a few high-impact ones — but **deeply**.

> Think: If you can solve one graph question in 3 different ways, you're already ahead.
